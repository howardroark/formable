Formable
========

Formable enables browser based editing of object states with the help of a
clearly defined schema. It has become incresingly popular to use data objects to
define how something will act. The process of editing these objects in raw
form can be awkward and completely infeasible for some users.  Formable aims
to standardize the process of defining how a form can be used to modify the
object data.
